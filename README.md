# triz-obok
Classic TRIZ BoK (v 2007 http://triz-summit.ru/en/203941/ by S.Litvin, V.Petrov, M.Rubin) looks more like syllabus but not as defined by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_knowledge (has no relations to skills, activities, tools), with not clear position of MATRIZ and without voice of community, and seems outdated from 2016 perpsective. New TRIZ oBoK v.2017 (invention theory open body of knowledge) on GitHub is intended to fix situation. Semantic features also are on the roadmap.
